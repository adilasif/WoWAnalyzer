# e2e

Extremely cursed script that generates a list of currently supported specs for
Playwright testing.

Run this script from the root folder to generate the appropriate file at [e2e/supportedSpecs.ts](e2e/supportedSpecs.ts).

```shell
$ pnpm dlx tsx ./scripts/e2e/generate-configs-bootstrap.cjs
```
